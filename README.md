# Okay everybody talk about the things they wanna work on
rn I'm trying to work on the input parser - I'm not sure if there was one that came with the csv package, but rn it's just a big ass list of different getLines - Katja

#^ Sounds good, also i think we def have to scale back our original plans lol and also based on robins comment on our proposal about how trees are just a subset of graphs, even though she didnt say we had to do something else, just to be safe we prob should do something thats obviously diff and a bit easier like maybe comparing two diff sorting algos we didnt cover i.e. timsort or radix sort or something with BFS vs DFS, which should be easier since we're just implementing that stuff and not the entire data structure on our own also someone I was talking to today was basically saying they grade leniently as long as you just turn something in so... #motivation

# Will also probably be abandoning any crazy visual ideas since it seems like we wont have enough time to teach ourselves, so lets just do a simple SFML GUI to play it safe since we've all done that already. I think its been mentioned we could just do a command line interface butttt im not the biggest fan of that and would rather have something fun and colorful to distract the ta with

# I'm going to start looking into different sorts/traversals and think of what our new thing we're comparing is/how it can be executed/applied - Alexa
